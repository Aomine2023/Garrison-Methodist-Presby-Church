                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                        <p>THE Garrison Methodist Presbyterian church (GMPC), Burma camp was founded in 1957 by a small group or worshipers who fellowshipped with other military personnel and their families at the saint George’s chapel, which was at the time, the designated place of worship for all Ghanaian protestant military and their families. </p>
                        <p>The group of worshipers, who among other things, wanted a much more spiritually congenial worship environment as against the tradition of sitting by military ranks in church which sometimes led to some members standing outside even when front pews were empty, decided to fellowship together. The group was given the name PMC because it was made up predominantly by Presbyterians, evangelical Presbyterians and Methodists, with few members from the AME Zion church.  The name PMC was later changed to MPC because the former conflicted with the office of the president of the mass committee also PMC. The MPC was initially led by Lt. Philemon F. Quaye (who became Rev. commodore P.F. Quaye from the evangelical Presbyterian church), corporal E. Ndounofit a very dedicated Nigerian soldier and Mr. S.K Geoferry Deho a civilian. Subsequently an expatriate minister, rev Noel Warman (1957 to 1959) took care of the church. Revered J.S.A Stephens was appointed as the first indigenous pastor of the church. He however stayed in office for two months. In thids same time period, the church had eight member council with Capt. P.F. Quaye as the only Ghanaian on the church council who worked hard for pastoral help for the church. </p>
                        <p>The MPC church started worshipping in a classroom at signal squadron training center and later moved to a chapel for the United States army which was renovated and sold to them at a high cost. In search for a bigger building for service on Sundays, the church renovated the small existing chapel which was more spacious. The selfless support of Major J. Koomson of the construction unit cannot be left out during this period. In 1961, a Sunday school service was introduced in the church by dedicated members such is Mrs Margaret Kweku – Kyereboah. Sgt. Moses Annor and Mrs Dorothy Sani – Thomas and after them many other people helped in managing the school. During Rev. (Lt.Col) Kofi Asare tenure, the church again decided to have a new building because of the increase in number. The military officials gave the church a site at the Burma camp entrance and progress was made on starting construction work after two churches harvests. Unfortunately, the church had a notice from the force commander at the time to stop all construction work on the site promising to pay the church refund. </p>
                        <p>The church continued in growth and the existing thirteen (13) members singing led by junior cadet officer Frederick ofosu Ntiri moved to form new and vibrant church choir which had a membership of twenty five (25) at the time of its inauguration on September 24, 1961. Regarding music, the church had a Hammond organ bought in 1967 at the first trade fair in Ghana at three thousand four hundred and forty two (3,442) new cedis to replace the old mannborg which had served for over 10 years. Members of the church supported to purchase this and even supported to repair the organ when broke down at a cost of three hundred thousand Ghana cedis (300,000). In 1662, the women’s fellowship was formed by few active group and gave birth to the singing band in 1965 by corporal J.C. Assan in order to have them sing our own indigenous choruses during church services. </p>
                        <p>The PMC through its Sunday afternoon church services started the 37 military hospital churches which was open to all denominations. In 1970, the wheel of the church, which is the youth fellowship, was established by devoted members of the church. Rev. Kweku Kyereboah retired two years after the formation of the youth fellowship. Rev Addae Kyeremah took over in 111978 and also helped froma Boys and Girls Brigade in the later part of 1979. There was a lot of clergy postings that came in which encouraged the information of men’s fellowship in 1985 this was done by some members together with the wife of Rev. Addae Kyeremeh. </p>
                        <p>A new building committee was then formed after Rev. Jonfia under Rev. Alphones Etsiba in 1994. In the same year there was a meeting and decision was taken to move again to the small old chapel adjacent the medical directorate. In 1996, a harvest was held to help build the church. The Garrison Methodist Presbyterian church from its beginning has had a lot of challenges specially with securing a better place for its members. However, the unity among the members and the strong desire to stay together and promote God’s work led the group to press on. </p>
                        <p>The church has been and still remains a source of inspiration to members of other churches in our country. Sometime in the year 2013 thereabout a building committee, chaired by Mrs. Adelaide Ahwireng was constituted to oversee the renovation and reconstruction of the entire building, which was about 80% complete. The church would re-dedicate its re-constructed building on 19th February 2017 and celebrate 60th anniversary on 29th October 2017. </p>
                        <p>The church is currently led by Rev (Cdr) Paul Adjei Djan and 15 members governing council. The church continues to maintain various committees and organizations to support its activities and members. They include the welfare fund and scheme trustees, women’s fellowship, men’s fellowship, choir, praise team, youth fellowship, junior youth fellowship, children service, boys and girls brigade, as well as Israel. </p>
